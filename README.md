# Password Generator Starter Code
# description
Within this website I wanted to make a website that will help users that can’t think of a new password for their accounts. I also added a criteria for the password generation in case there is a website that dont expect certain symbols, letters, and numbers. Once the user hits the generate button they will be prompted with criteria choices and once they have finished there criteria choices they will be generated a random password. If they don’t input any of the criteria or put in a wrong value they will be returned to the beginning until they chose within the given ranges of the criteria.
